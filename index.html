			<h3>VR industry</h3>
			<p>
				Nowadays, Virtual Reality (VR) is actively capturing the entertainment industry all over the world. This is not surprising&#8202;—&#8202;thanks to modern technology, virtual reality guarantees a completely new level of perception and opportunities. According to analysts, the VR industry is likely to become a multi-billion-dollar market in the nearest future. Over the past few years, virtual reality has evolved into one of the most promising areas in the entertainment industry that has become the target for largest IT corporations. According to the estimates of Digi-Capital, the total volume of venture and corporate investments in the AR / VR sphere was at $ 1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2017.
			</p>
			<h3>Revolutianary technological solution</h3>
			<p>
				VR Technologies has developed a solution that will attract thousands of developers and authors from all over the world to create and monetize high-quality VR content. This solution is the VRT platform, which is a decentralized VR marketplace. The platform is based on the blockchain technology, which guarantees transparent distribution of funds and enforcement of intellectual property rights. In addition, the platform will host available SDKs and APIs, which will greatly simplify the creation of VR content. As a result, it will attract the widest range of stakeholders to participate in the development of the system.
			</p>
			<h3>Unique selling point</h3>
			<p>
				The key advantage of the project will be that VR Technologies VR parks will become an offline gateway to the marketplace, allowing third-party developers to sell their content without spending money on expensive equipment. In addition, an emulator will be created that will provide developers with a chance to test their products before launching.
			</p>

			<h3>VR market growth</h3>
			<p>
				VR trend is obvious&#8202;—&#8202;a significant growth of the virtual reality market is expected, and one of the main drivers of this movement will be the video game segment. First of all, it is due to the number of potential customers interested in this product. Goldman Sachs estimates that the existing gaming audience accounts about 380 million people&#8202;—&#8202;of which 230 million have gaming consoles, and another 150 million are PC players in developed countries.
			</p>
			<h3>Use of blockchain</h3>
			<p>
				Blockchain technology, which is the basis of the project, will ensure the transparency of income distribution between the developers and the platform, and also guarantees the observance of copyrights to the products sold. This will result in a more equitable distribution of funds between the creators of the content and the site for its placement. As an outcome, the cost of the final product will become more affordable for consumers.
			</p>
			<h3>Technology of the future</h3>
			<p>
				The popularization of VR is about socialization, not isolation. Under a certain angle, virtual reality can be considered as the Internet, but in fact, its potential is much greater. This is a place where a person can immerse completely, finding much more there than in real life. VR is able to solve a lot of problems, and the VRT project makes the way to the future accessible and real. This solution combines the two most promising IT areas: VR and blockchain.

			<h3>Solution for developers</h3>
			<p>
				SDK is a technology for working with Virtual Reality. The reason VRT created its SDK is to give developers a chance to create high-quality VR content for distribution.
			</p>

			<h3>SDK</h3>
			<p>
				The VRT team and the most active members of the VRT community will control the relevance and development of new technology, adding to the SDK and earning VRT tokens as a reward. With this constant development of the SDK, we can offer the most current solution for creating VR content.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have already prepared templates for integration of our full-body teaching technology with different devices. We will update them during the further development of the SDK.
			</p>

			<h3>Integration with graphic engines</h3>
			<p>
				Our solution is now integrated with several graphic engines, including Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and CryEngine, so our technology can be used to solve different issues. With the opportunity to choose an engine, developers get the chance to optimize their project both for mobile devices and specialized computers, adapted for VR.
			</p>
			<h3>System of VRT tracking</h3>
			<p>
				Our programmers have developed the module that allows tracking of all movements of specialized tags in space and transfer of the data on them into different applications. This system supports skeletal animation as well as rigid body, which enables the transfer of both users and other real life objects to VR. The module can also work with different systems of optical or hybrid tracking.
			</p>
			<h3>VRT&#8202;—&#8202;full-body tracking emulator</h3>
			<p>
				A test environment and content-testing instruments are designed for developers who do not have their own systems for tracking. This set of instruments consists of pre-recorded assets of movements, which together with a set of modules, allow testing of content with no need to buy costly equipment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, the test environment allows developers to plug into the VR parks infrastructure and run tests using their equipment and infrastructure. In this case, content will be run in a special container, for tracking tests results and ensures a high level of safety in order to prevent possible intrusion of harmful programs.
			</p>
			<h3>How does SDK help in developing VR content?</h3>
			<p>
				SDK is a set of ready-to-use functions and templates for solving problems. In other words, SDK allows use of the VRT libraries, so developers do not have to write tracking code themselves and spend years on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Interested in our SDK? Stay tuned! We are working on our technology and plan to release the SDK by the end of 2018. You will be able to purchase the SDK at dev.vrt.world for tokens.
